During Week 1, I encountered an issue in Visual Studio where my virtual environment was not activated. 
Normally, the command prompt should display the prefix (venv), for example: (venv) C:\Users\Kingm\Downloads\lab1\lab-1> 
Since it did not, my virtual environment was off. 
As a result, I did not create the database from the cloned repository (https://github.com/PLP-Database-DEPT/lab-1.git) 
during the class activity; we only added the username, password, and database name manually.
I'm not overly concerned at this point, but it would be great to resolve the issue so that I can edit code in Visual Studio 
and push it to my SQL database. I'll continue working on this and will update you with any fixes in the Week 2 assignment.

Thank you, and have an awesome day.
